  "description": "The flag of Italy is a tricolor featuring three equally sized vertical pales of green, white, and red, with the green at the hoist side. Some have attributed particular values to the colors, and a common interpretation is that the green represents the countryâ€™s plains and the hills; white, the snow-capped Alps; and red, blood spilled in the Wars of Italian Independence.",
