  "description": "The state flag of Moldova is a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red, charged with the coat of arms of Moldova on the center bar. The coat of arms features an eagle holding a shield charged with an aurochs (extinct type of large wild cattle, which is the ancestor of domestic cattle). The blue, red, and yellow tricolor of Moldova is almost identical to the flag of Romania, reflecting the two countries' national and cultural affinity.",
