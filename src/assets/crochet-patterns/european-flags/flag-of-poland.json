  "description": "The flag of Poland consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one white and the lower one red. The two colors are defined in the Polish constitution as the national colors. White and red were officially adopted as national colors in 1831. Horizontal bi-colors of white and red being a relatively widespread design, there are several flags that are similar but unrelated to the Polish one.",
